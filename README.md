ARTIFACT Conference 2013 Screen Saver
========================

Since [ARTIFACT](http://artifactconf.com) took place in a dinner movie theater, we wanted to put something on the screen during the lunch break that:

* wasn't a slidedeck on repeat or 
* too distracting to keep attendee conversations from happening, but 
* also visually interesting that 
* added or kept to the emerging design brand.

Not an easy challenge.

Thankfully, Miles Tilmann of [Pixeljam](http://www.pixeljam.com) rose to the challenge.

Here are Macintosh OS and Windows OS screensavers of the lunchtime visual spiral graphs. 

## For Mactinosh OS Users

In Macintosh OS X Mountain Lion or higher, the Gatekeeper feature prevents software from unidentified developers to be installed automatically. 

To work around this issue, use the following steps:

1. Control+Click or right click on the screenscaver app and select Open from the contextual menu.
2. A pop-up warning appears stating that the app is from an unidentified developer.
3. Click Open if youâ€™re sure you want to install the app.
